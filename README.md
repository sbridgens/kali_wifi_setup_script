# kali wifi setup script

Just a basic script to bring a wlan0 interface up to monitor mode and start airodump-ng if required, once you have the interface running in monitor mode, then running airodump-ng you can use the process below in order to capture wireless data and aim to crack the wpa password.

Its worth noting here that airodump-ng has some awesome interactive features which i have briefly written about on my blog:  https://innogen-security.com/airodump-ng-interaction/
